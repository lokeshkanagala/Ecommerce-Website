## What is done here?

##### This web application is a demostration of an e-commerce web application using NodeJS and Elastic Search.  

##### User authentication and Route protection is achieved using PassportJS. MongoDB is used for the database and Faker API is used to populate some fake data into the application.

##### This application will allow user to create an Account and view various products from different categories like gadgets, groceries, clothing, toys etc,. The user can add these products into the cart and can checkout by providing his card details. 

### Since, we are using Faker API here, the product description and image couldn't be relevant. As there are more then 500 products, providing an image and suitable description for all products is a hard task. However, for a real world application, one can load actual/meaningful data into the database.
